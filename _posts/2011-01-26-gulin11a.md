title: Winning The Transfer Learning Track of Yahoo!’s Learning To Rank Challenge
  with YetiRank
abstract: "The problem of ranking the documents according to their relevance to a
  given query is a hot topic in information retrieval. Most learning-to-rank methods
  are supervised and use human editor judgements for learning. In this paper, we introduce
  novel pairwise method called YetiRank that modifies Friedman’s gradient boosting
  method in part of gradient computation for optimization and takes uncertainty in
  human judgements into account. Proposed enhancements allowed YetiRank to outperform
  many state-of-the-art learning to rank methods in oï¬\x84ine experiments as well
  as take the first place in the second track of the Yahoo! learning-to-rank contest.
  Even more remarkably, the first result in the learning to rank competition that
  consisted of a transfer learning task was achieved without ever relying on the bigger
  data from the “transfer-from” domain."
