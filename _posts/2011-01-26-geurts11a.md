title: Learning to rank with extremely randomized trees
abstract: In this paper, we report on our experiments on the Yahoo! Labs Learning
  to Rank challenge organized in the context of the 23rd International Conference
  of Machine Learning (ICML 2010). We competed in both the learning to rank and the
  transfer learning tracks of the challenge with several tree-based ensemble methods,
  including Tree Bagging (?), Random Forests (?), and Extremely Randomized Trees (?).
  Our methods ranked 10th in the first track and 4th in the second track. Although
  not at the very top of the ranking, our results show that ensembles of randomized
  trees are quite competitive for the “learning to rank” problem. The paper also analyzes
  computing times of our algorithms and presents some post-challenge experiments with
  transfer learning methods.
