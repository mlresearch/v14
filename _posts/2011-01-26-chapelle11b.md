title: Future directions in learning to rank
abstract: 'The results of the learning to rank challenge showed that the quality of
  the predictions from the top competitors are very close from each other. This raises
  a question: is learning to rank a solved problem? On the on hand, it is likely that
  only small incremental progress can be made in the ``core'''' and traditional problematics
  of learning to rank. The challenge was set in this standard learning to rank scenario:
  optimize a ranking measure on a test set. But on the other hand, there are a lot
  of related questions and settings in learning to rank that have not been yet fully
  explored. We review some of them in this paper and hope that researchers interested
  in learning to rank will try to answer these challenging and exciting research questions.'
